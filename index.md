# Haruka Tomobe (Ph.D.)


I graduated from the Graduate School of Agriculture at the Kyoto University (Kyoto, Japan) in 2020 and was awarded a PhD, in which I was investigating the constitutive model for root-soil interfaces and started the development of a multi-physical numerical simulator for plants based on the finite element method, named plantFEM (https://github.com/kazulagi/plantFEM.git). I got an Assistant Professor position at the National Institute of Technology, Toyota College in 2020 to work on plant-soil mechanical interaction and its application for geo-structural designing, and developed coupling analysis for soil, water and root growth. From 2021, I am working at the Tokyo Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor, where I am developing overset mesh scheme for non-conforming finite element meshes, which is a key technology to simulate the dynamic behavior of plant-soil-atmosphere systems.
